This document outlines a modern tech stack recommendation for building a healthcare application that captures patient and clinical data using REST APIs and a Single Page Application (SPA) front end.

== üîß Backend (REST APIs)

*Languages & Frameworks:*

* Java + Spring Boot (mature, widely used in healthcare and enterprise apps)
* OR Node.js + Express (lightweight and fast to prototype)

*Database:*

* PostgreSQL ‚Äì for structured clinical and patient data (preferred for transactional integrity)
* MongoDB ‚Äì if your clinical data is semi-structured (e.g., storing observations, symptoms in a dynamic schema)

*Authentication & Authorization:*

* Spring Security with JWT (Java)
* OR Auth0 / Firebase Auth for faster integration

*API Documentation:*

* Swagger / OpenAPI ‚Äì for documenting and testing APIs

== üé® Frontend (SPA)

*Frameworks:*

* Angular ‚Äì for enterprise-grade SPAs with strong typing and structure
* OR React ‚Äì flexible and popular for modern UIs
* OR Vue.js ‚Äì simpler learning curve, great for mid-sized projects

*UI Component Libraries:*

* Angular: Angular Material
* React: MUI (Material UI) or Ant Design
* Vue: Vuetify

*State Management:*

* Angular: NgRx (for large apps)
* React: Redux or Zustand
* Vue: Pinia

== üîê Security (Essential for Healthcare Apps)

* HTTPS (TLS/SSL)
* Input validation & sanitization (to prevent XSS, SQL Injection)
* OAuth2 + JWT
* Role-based access control (Patient, Doctor, Admin)

== ‚òÅÔ∏è Optional Enhancements

*Deployment:*

* Docker + Kubernetes (for scalable deployment)
* OR simpler options like Heroku or Render

*Logging & Monitoring:*

* ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* OR Prometheus + Grafana

*File Storage:*

* AWS S3 or Azure Blob for storing medical reports, scans, etc.
